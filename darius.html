		<div class="subpage-content">
			<p>Darius, the Hand of Noxus, is a juggernaut typically found in the top lane. However, his oppressive kit can be surprisingly effective in the support role. He brings immense pressure, crowd control, and kill potential to the bot lane.</p>
			<h2>Abilities and Strategy</h2>
			<p>Darius's Apprehend (E) is a powerful tool for a support. It allows him to pull in and slow enemies, setting up kills for his ADC. His Crippling Strike (W) provides an additional slow and resets his auto-attack, while his Decimate (Q) offers sustain and AoE damage.</p>
			<p>In lane, Darius support focuses on creating an all-in kill lane. His passive, Hemorrhage, applies a bleed that stacks, and at 5 stacks, he gains a massive amount of bonus attack damage. This makes extended trades incredibly favorable for him and his lane partner.</p>
			<h2>Why it Works</h2>
			<p>Darius support is a cheese pick that excels at punishing immobile ADCs. His ability to pull enemies out of position and his sheer damage output can create a snowball effect that is difficult to stop. While he lacks traditional support utility, his aggressive, all-in nature can secure lane dominance and transition into a formidable frontline presence for his team.</p>
