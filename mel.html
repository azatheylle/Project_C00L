		<div class="subpage-content">
			<p>Mel Medarda, reimagined as a support, plays a tempo‑control game. She doesn’t out‑heal or out‑burst; she out‑positions and punishes overcommitment, turning enemy aggression into winning turns for her team—especially through a well‑timed W.</p>
			<h2>Abilities and Strategy</h2>
			<p><strong>Rebuttal (W)</strong> erects a barrier around Mel, making her invulnerable to non‑turret damage during the window. Any hostile, champion‑sourced projectile that hits the barrier is deleted, then immediately mirrored as Mel’s own projectile back toward its source. The mirrored shots keep the original’s properties but deal a percentage of the original damage as magic, scaling with AP. Timed into a “game‑winning” ult, Rebuttal flips the script—what should end the fight instead becomes the reason the enemy team collapses.</p>
			<p>In lane, play for space and cooldown trades: poke safely, use root/zone control to set angles, and hold W as a constant threat. When enemies commit key projectiles or bring jungle pressure, step in to catch with W and instantly turn while their own tools fire back at them.</p>
			<h2>Why it Works</h2>
			<p>Mel punishes linear skillshot comps and telegraphed, projectile‑based teamfight ultimates. She rewards foresight and objective setup; while she lacks raw healing, her power to blank the opening volley and convert it into threat makes her a high‑impact, coordination‑friendly support.</p>
