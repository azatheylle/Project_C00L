		<div class="subpage-content">
			<p>Qiyana, the Empress of the Elements, is a fearsome assassin who can adapt her abilities to the terrain around her. As a support, she brings a high-damage, high-mobility playstyle that can dominate the bot lane and create opportunities for her ADC to snowball.</p>
			<h2>Abilities and Strategy</h2>
			<p>Qiyana's strength as a support lies in her ability to use her Elemental Wrath / Edge of Ixtal (Q) with different elements. With the river, she can root enemies, setting up easy kills for her ADC. With the wall, she deals bonus damage to low-health targets, and with the brush, she leaves a trail of invisibility for herself and her allies.</p>
			<p>Her Audacious Charge (E) allows her to dash to enemies, while her ultimate, Supreme Display of Talent (R), can stun an entire team if aimed correctly against a wall. This combination of crowd control and burst damage makes her a potent kill-lane support.</p>
			<h2>Why it Works</h2>
			<p>Qiyana support thrives in aggressive lane compositions. She can lock down enemies, provide burst damage, and even offer utility with her brush element. While she is a high-risk, high-reward pick, a skilled Qiyana can completely take over the bot lane and transition into a powerful secondary carry for her team.</p>
